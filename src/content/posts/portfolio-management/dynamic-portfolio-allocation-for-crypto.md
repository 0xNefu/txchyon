## What Is Dynamic Portfolio Allocation?

Dynamic portfolio allocation is the practice of **adjusting your crypto asset weights over time** based on market conditions, volatility, and performance.

Unlike static allocation, which remains fixed, dynamic allocation helps you:

- Capture upside during strong trends  
- Reduce exposure in high-risk periods  
- Optimize risk-adjusted returns

Crypto markets are highly volatile. Static allocations may:

- Overweight winners after sharp rallies  
- Underweight assets before rebounds  
- Expose your portfolio to avoidable risk  

Dynamic allocation introduces **flexibility while maintaining control**.
