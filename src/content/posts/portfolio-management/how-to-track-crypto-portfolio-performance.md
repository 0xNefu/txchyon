## Why Tracking Portfolio Performance Matters

You can have a perfectly allocated and rebalanced portfolio, but **if you don't track performance**, you won't know:

- if risk is creeping up unnoticed  
- which assets are underperforming  

Tracking performance gives insight into both **returns** and **risk management**.
