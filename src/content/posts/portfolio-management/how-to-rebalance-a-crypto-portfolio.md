## What Is Crypto Portfolio Rebalancing?

Crypto portfolio rebalancing is the process of **bringing your asset percentages back to their original target allocation** after price movements cause them to drift.

Example:
- Bitcoin pumps → becomes overweight  
- Altcoins lag → become underweight  

Rebalancing fixes this *without emotion*.

> Allocation sets the plan. Rebalancing enforces it.

## Why Rebalancing Matters in Crypto

Crypto markets move fast. If you never rebalance:

- winners quietly increase your risk  
- volatility compounds against you  
- drawdowns become harder to recover from  

Rebalancing helps you:  

- lock in gains systematically  
- control risk without guessing tops  
- stay aligned with your long-term strategy

## When Should You Rebalance a Crypto Portfolio?

There are three common rebalancing triggers.

### 1️⃣ Time-Based Rebalancing

You rebalance on a fixed schedule:
- monthly  
- quarterly  
- semi-annually  

**Pros**
- simple  
- easy to automate  

**Cons**
- may rebalance unnecessarily during low volatility  

Best for beginners.

### 2️⃣ Threshold-Based Rebalancing

You rebalance only when an asset drifts beyond a set percentage.

Example:
- Target BTC = 40%  
- Rebalance if it exceeds 45% or drops below 35%  

**Pros**
- more efficient  
- avoids overtrading  

**Cons**
- requires tracking  

Best for experienced investors.

### 3️⃣ Hybrid Rebalancing

A mix of both:
- check monthly  
- rebalance only if thresholds are breached  

This is the **most practical approach** for most portfolios.

## Rebalancing vs Risk Management

Rebalancing controls *exposure*, not *absolute downside*.  

To protect against deep drawdowns, you’ll also need:
- position sizing  
- stablecoin buffers  
- downside planning

## How Rebalancing Affects Performance

Rebalancing:
- smooths volatility  
- reduces drawdowns  
- can slightly reduce peak upside in exchange for survivability  

To measure its impact properly, track:  
- realized vs unrealized gains  
- risk-adjusted returns
