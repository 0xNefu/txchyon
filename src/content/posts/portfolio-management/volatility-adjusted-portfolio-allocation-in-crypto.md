## What Is Volatility-Adjusted Allocation?

Volatility-adjusted allocation **weights assets based on their historical or expected volatility**:

- High-volatility assets get smaller weights  
- Low-volatility assets get larger weights  

This keeps overall portfolio risk consistent over time.

## How to Implement

1. Calculate volatility for each asset  
2. Determine target risk level for the portfolio  
3. Assign weights inversely proportional to volatility  
4. Rebalance as volatility changes
